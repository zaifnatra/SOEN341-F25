  "description": "This project is a Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application which allows students to discover, organize, and attend events on campus. The system supports three main users: Students, Organizers, and Administrators. Students can find and attend events of their choosing by saving favorites and claiming tickets with QR-based check-in. In addition, organizers can also create events and track analytics, including participation rates. Finally, administrators provide a platform oversight to ensure smooth operation of events. Together, these features streamline event management and boost student involvement on campus.",
