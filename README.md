## **Description**

This project is a Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application which allows students to discover, organize, and attend events on campus. The system supports three main users: Students, Organizers, and Administrators. Students can find and attend events of their choosing by saving favorites and claiming tickets with QR-based check-in. In addition, organizers can also create events and track analytics, including participation rates. Finally, administrators provide a platform oversight to ensure smooth operation of events. Together, these features streamline event management and boost student involvement on campus.

## **Objective**

The objective of this project is to apply web development skills alongside modern software development practices (documentation, version control review, testing, CI/CD, agile methodology) to develop a web application that aims to promote student life on campus.
