## **Description**

This project is a Campus Events & Ticketing Web Application which allows students to discover, organize, and attend events on campus. The system supports three main users: Students, Organizers, and Administrators. Students can find and attend events of their choosing by saving favorites and claiming tickets with QR-based check-in. In addition, organizers can also create events and track analytics, including participation rates. Finally, administrators provide a platform oversight to ensure smooth operation of events. Together, these features streamline event management and boost student involvement on campus.

## **Objective**

The objective of this project is to design and implement a comprehensive web application that streamlines campus event discovery, ticketing and attendance management for students, organizers and administrators. The systems aims to enhance student engagement by making events more accessible, simplify event organization through management tools and provide insight on what to do trough analytics dashboards. By integrating features like digital ticketing, QR-code check-ins and administrative moderation, the platform provides a more connected and organized campus community.
